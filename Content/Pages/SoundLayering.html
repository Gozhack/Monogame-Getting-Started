<h1>Layering Sounds</h1>

<p>In this article, we will layer 3 sound files together to create dynamic game music. <br>
This article assumes that you have completed all the other Sound tutorials.<br>
This article starts with a new MonoGame project, created in the article 
<a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Building A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>





<br>
<h3>Download the Sound Files</h3>
<p>
First, you'll need to download the three sound files below.<br>
Each sound file represents a part of the complete song "Iota".<br>
<br>
IotaPart1 represents the main progression of the song.<br>
IotaPart2 represents a melody played over the main progression, with a different instrument.<br>
IotaPart3 is a drum track that matches the tempo of the progression and melody parts.<br>
<br>
Right click each link and choose 'Save As...' then save it to your project's Content folder.<br>
Make sure the sounds have the .WAV file extension.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/IotaPart1.wav" >IotaPart1.wav</a></center><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/IotaPart2.wav" >IotaPart2.wav</a></center><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/IotaPart3.wav" >IotaPart3.wav</a></center>
<br><br>



<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Add the Music Tracks to Your Project Using the Pipeline Tool</h3>
<p>
Locate the .WAV files, add them to the pipeline tool, and build the pipeline project.<br>
Your Content folder and pipeline project should look like the image below.<br>
Refer to the <a href="SoundAdding.html" target="display">Adding Sounds</a> article if you are unfamiliar with how to add project assets.
</p>

<h3>Update Game1.cs</h3>
<p>
Replace Game1's code with the code below.

            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);

            IotaPart1 = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart1");
            IotaPart2 = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart2");

            IotaPart3Instance.Play();
        }

        protected override void UnloadContent() { }

        public void FadeTrack(bool TrackState, SoundEffectInstance MusicTrack)
        {
            if (TrackState) //the music track should be heard
            { if (MusicTrack.Volume < 1.0f) { MusicTrack.Volume += fadeSpeed; } }
            else //the music track should not be heard
            { if (MusicTrack.Volume > 0.01f) { MusicTrack.Volume -= fadeSpeed; } }

            if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.E)) { playPart3 = true; }

            //asd keys mute parts 123

<br>
<p>
There shouldn't be any errors in your project.<br>
Build the project. You should see a blue screen.<br>
Music will start playing.<br>
<br>
If you press the A key, track 1 will fade out.<br>
If you press the S key, track 2 will fade out.<br>
If you press the D key, track 3 will fade out.<br>
<br>
If you press the Q key, track 1 will fade in.<br>
If you press the W key, track 2 will fade in.<br>
If you press the E key, track 3 will fade in.<br>
<br>
Play around with these controls, listening to the tracks fade in and out.<br>
</p>






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect Game1.cs</h3>
<p>
Lets inspect the changes we made to Game1.cs.<br>
First, since we are using sound files, we need to tell Game1.cs where to find Monogame's sound classes.<br>
This is done by the code below, which essentially 'imports' the audio classes defined in the Xna Framework.<br>
Recall that Monogame is based on XNA.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio;
</textarea>		






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>SoundEffects, SoundEffectInstances, and Control Booleans</h3>
<p>
Recall that a SoundEffect loads a sound file, and a SoundEffectInstance controls a sound file.<br>
Inside Game1.cs we create three SoundEffects and three SoundEffectInstances.<br>
We also create three booleans to control if a SoundEffectInstance should be heard or should be muted.<br>
Finally, we create a float value to control how quickly the game should fade a sound in or out.
</p>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
SoundEffect IotaPart1;
SoundEffect IotaPart2;
SoundEffect IotaPart3;

SoundEffectInstance IotaPart1Instance;
SoundEffectInstance IotaPart2Instance;
SoundEffectInstance IotaPart3Instance;

bool playPart1 = true;
bool playPart2 = true;
bool playPart3 = true;

float fadeSpeed = 0.01f;
</textarea>	









<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect LoadContent()</h3>
<p>
In the LoadContent method we load the song parts into our ContentManager.<br>
We set the SoundEffect variables to equal our loaded content.<br>
Then we create the SoundEffectInstances that will control our sound files.<br>
<br>
Note that we set each song part to loop. <br>
This ensures the song parts always stay synchronized with each other.<br>
Part1 is 8 bars long, while Part3 is 16 bars long. Part3 is 1 bar long.<br>
<br>
Also note that we start playing all the song parts at the same time.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="25" readonly>
protected override void LoadContent()
{
	spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);

	IotaPart1 = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart1");
	IotaPart2 = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart2");
	IotaPart3 = Content.Load<SoundEffect>("IotaPart3");
	
	IotaPart1Instance = IotaPart1.CreateInstance();
	IotaPart2Instance = IotaPart2.CreateInstance();
	IotaPart3Instance = IotaPart3.CreateInstance();

	IotaPart1Instance.IsLooped = true;
	IotaPart2Instance.IsLooped = true;
	IotaPart3Instance.IsLooped = true;

	IotaPart1Instance.Play();
	IotaPart2Instance.Play();
	IotaPart3Instance.Play();
}
</textarea>	








<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect the New Method FadeTrack()</h3>
<p>
Here we have created a new method for Game1.cs called FadeTrack().<br>
Inside of FadeTrack's parentheses we see there are two variables. <br>
This means the method we have created accepts two parameters, a Boolean and a SoundEffectInstance.<br>
<br>
The Boolean value is named TrackState.<br>
The SoundEffectInstance is named MusicTrack.<br>
We use these two variables to determine if the we should fade the MusicTrack's volume up or down.<br>
<br>
If TrackState equals true, we fade the MusicTrack's volume up to 1.0.<br>
If TrackState equals false, we fade the MusicTrack's volume down to 0.01.<br>
We pass our musical parts to this method, where they will be faded based on the boolean value we pass.
</p>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
public void FadeTrack(bool TrackState, SoundEffectInstance MusicTrack)
{
	if (TrackState) //the music track should be heard
	{ if (MusicTrack.Volume < 1.0f) { MusicTrack.Volume += fadeSpeed; } }
	else //the music track should not be heard
	{ if (MusicTrack.Volume > 0.01f) { MusicTrack.Volume -= fadeSpeed; } }
}
</textarea>	








<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspect Update()</h3>
<p>
Finally, we modified Update() to check the keyboard for user input.<br>
Based on the keys the user presses, we flip our control booleans on or off.<br>
Remember, these booleans represent if a part should be playing or muted.<br>
<br>
Once we have set our boolean values, we then pass each boolean to our FadeTrack() method.<br>
We also pass the corresponding SoundEffectInstance representing that musical part.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="20" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
	//qwe keys play parts 123
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Q)) { playPart1 = true; }
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.W)) { playPart2 = true; }
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.E)) { playPart3 = true; }

	//asd keys mute parts 123
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.A)) { playPart1 = false; }
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.S)) { playPart2 = false; }
	if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.D)) { playPart3 = false; }

	FadeTrack(playPart1, IotaPart1Instance);
	FadeTrack(playPart2, IotaPart2Instance);
	FadeTrack(playPart3, IotaPart3Instance);

	base.Update(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	








<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You can now control what song parts are playing with the keyboard.<br>
You should have an understanding of how to handle multiple SoundEffectInstances playing in sync with each other.<br>
Using this basic approach, you can expand the code to adapt to conditions in your game.<br>
<br>
For example, imagine the Hero in your game sees enemies approaching - you could fade the drums in.<br>
Or you could fade in a different musical part of the song - a different melody or bassline.<br>
When the enemies are defeated, you could fade the drums out and change back to the prior melody or bassline.<br>
<br>
When a new level loads, you could load different musical parts - then fade between them based on level conditions.<br>
This concept can even be applied to non-musical sounds.<br>
Perhaps the level starts raining - you could then trigger the rain sound to fade in and loop.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b> - musical parts that share a tempo should start playing at the same time.<br>
Stopping or Pausing a musical part will cause it to fall out of sync with the other musical parts.<br>
Unless you are tracking a part's duration, it is difficult to determine when to re-sync musical parts.
