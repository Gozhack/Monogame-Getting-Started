<h1>Adding a Texture</h1>


<p>In this article, we will add a texture asset to your game's pipeline tool, and build the asset into a XNB. <br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>




<h3>Copy the Image Asset</h3>
<p>
First, you'll need to download the image below. <br>
Right click the image and choose 'Save As...' then save it to your project's Content folder.<br>
Note that this image is a PNG file and has transparent pixels.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/monogamelogo46px.png"></center>
<br><br>





<h3>Launch the Pipeline Tool</h3>
<p>
Navigate to your project's Content folder and double click on Content.mgcb.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex1.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
The pipeline tool will open. <br>
Note that you have opened your game's .mgcb file, which is linked to your game project.<br>
You will start with an empty pipeline window like below.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex2.jpg"></center>
<br><br>






<h3>Add the Image Asset</h3>
<p>
Now we will add our downloaded image to the pipeline tool.<br>
Click Edit > Add > Existing Item...
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex3.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Locate the downloaded image in the file browser.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex4.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Double click the image, or click the 'open' button.<br>
Now your content pipeline window should look like below.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex5.jpg"></center>
<br><br>





<h3>Build the Pipeline Assets</h3>
<p>
Note the 'Build Action' in the 'Settings' section. <br>
This tells the pipeline tool how to build your game asset. <br>
This should default to 'Build' and the Importer setting should default to 'Texture'.<br>
Now let's build our texture to a XNB file.<br>
Click Build > Build, or press F6.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex6.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
The results of building should look like below.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/addTex7.jpg"></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Note that two additional folders have been added to your Content folder, <b>bin</b> and <b>obj</b>.
Don't worry too much about understanding why these folders exist right now.
You do need to know that the XNB that was built exists in the <b>bin</b> folder.
My project is a Windows OpenGL project, so my XNB is located at <b>/bin/DesktopGL</b>.
Navigate to your XNB file and inspect it's properties. 
You can see that the PNG was transformed into a XNB with the same name.
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Your texture asset is now ready to be loaded into your game and drawn to the screen.
We'll cover this in the next article <a href="TextureDrawing.html" target="display">Drawing a Texture</a>.
