<h1>What is A Class?</h1>


<p>In this article, we will discuss the properties of a <b>Class</b>.<br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>





<h3>Classes Defined</h3>
<p>
A class is a collection of variables and functions that you define, like a blueprint.<br>
The variables and functions of a class are called <b>members</b> of the class.<br>
When you define a function in a class, that function can be referred to as a <b>method</b>.<br>
<br>
Objects are <b>instances of a class</b>.<br>
So when you call a classes function, you are accessing an object's method.<br>
This is done using the dot (.) operator.<br>
<br>
Inspect the code below.<br>
This is a compacted version of Game1.cs.<br>
You should be familiar with Game1.cs.
</p>







<textarea rows="30" readonly>
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;

namespace Game1
{
    public class Game1 : Game
    {
        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;
        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;

        public Game1()
        {
            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this); Content.RootDirectory = "Content";
        }
        protected override void Initialize() { base.Initialize(); }
        protected override void LoadContent() { spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice); }
        protected override void UnloadContent() {}
        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) { base.Update(gameTime); }
        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue); base.Draw(gameTime);
        }
    }
}
</textarea>	
<p>
This code defines a class called Game1.<br>
<br>
Inside Game1 we see there are two variables defined, <b>graphics</b> and <b>spriteBatch</b>.<br>
Each of these variables has a type, <b>GraphicsDeviceManager</b> and <b>SpriteBatch</b>.<br>
The variable <b>graphics</b> is an <b>instance</b> of the class <b>GraphicsDeviceManager</b>.<br>
The variable <b>spriteBatch</b> is an <b>instance</b> of the class <b>SpriteBatch</b>.<br>
<br>
These two variables are <b>members</b> of the Game1 class.<br>
You would access these variables with the following syntax: <b>Game1.graphics</b> and <b>Game1.spriteBatch</b>.<br>
<br>
Now let's look at Game1's functions, also called Game1's <b>methods</b>.<br>
</p>






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Methods Defined</h3>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
public Game1() {}

protected override void Initialize() {}

protected override void LoadContent() {}

protected override void UnloadContent() {}

protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) {}

protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime) {}
</textarea>	
<p>
The Game1 class defines 6 methods: <b>Game1(), Initialize(), LoadContent(), UnloadContent(), Update(), and Draw()</b>.<br>
These methods are also known as class members - they belong to the class of Game1.<br>
You would access these variables with the following syntax: <b>Game1.LoadContent(), Game1.Update(),</b> etc...<br>
Note the Game1() method in the code above. This method is known as a <b>Constructor</b>.<br>
</p>












<br><br><br><br>
<h3>The Constructor Method</h3>
<p>
The Constructor method is called when an instance of the class is created.<br>
Inspect the code below.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
var game = new Game1();
</textarea>	
<p>
Here we are creating a variable called <b>game</b>.<br>
Then we define <b>game</b> to be an instance of the class <b>Game1</b>.<br>
The object <b>game</b> is created, and the Constructor method - <b>game.Game1()</b> - is called automatically.<br>
<br>
</p>











<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Methods That Take Parameters</h3>
<p>
Note the method defined below, Update().<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) {}
</textarea>	
<p>
You can see that Update has an object in it's parentheses called <b>GameTime gameTime</b>.<br>
<b>GameTime</b> defines the type. <b>gameTime</b> is the name of the object.<br>
We could change the name of the object to something different, for example: <b>GameTime updateTime</b>.<br>
<br>
An object in a function or method's parentheses is known as a <b>parameter</b>.<br>
We would describe the Update method as <b>taking one parameter</b>, an object of the GameTime type.<br>
This parameter would be available inside Update's scope, which is defined by <b>curly brackets {}</b>.<br>
</p>







<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Scope Defined</h3>
<p>
Note the <b>curly brackets {}</b> below in Update().<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) 
{
	//gameTime can be used here
}
//gameTime cannot be used here
</textarea>	
<p>
These curly brackets define the scope of the Update() method.<br>
Parameters that are passed to a method become available <b>inside a method's scope</b>.<br>
However, a method's parameters cannot be used outside of the method's scope.<br>
<br>
This is true for members of a class too.<br>
Members defined inside a classes scope cannot be used outside of the class.<br>
A classes members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
var game = new Game1();

Update(); //cannot be accessed like this
game.Update(); //can be accessed like this
</textarea>	








<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You should now have a basic understanding of what a class is.<br>
<br>
You should know what class members and methods are.<br>
You should understand the differences between a class and an object.<br>
You should understand what an instance is.<br>
<br>
You should know how to access a member of a class - using the dot (.) operator.<br>
You should understand how scope is defined - using curly brackets {}.<br>
You should understand what a Constructor method is and when it is called.<br>
</p>
