<h1>Publishing</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will discuss publishing a completed game.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>What is Publishing?</h3>
<p>
Publishing is the process of sharing your game with others.<br>
Usually, this is done using an installer, such as Click Once.<br>
This can also be done by distributing an application file plus required dlls and the content folder.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that different computers have different hardware and software setups.<br>
Your game may not run, or may run incorrectly, on some computers.<br>
This may be due to a driver issue, a GPU issue, an OS issue, or some other hardware/software issue.<br>
Without specific error information, it can be impossible to determine what's causing the problem.<br>
