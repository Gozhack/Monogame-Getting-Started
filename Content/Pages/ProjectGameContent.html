<h1>Project Content vs Game Content</h1>

<p>
This article explains the differences between a project's Content folder and a game's Content folder.<br>
<b>Note that a game's Content folder is not the same as a project's Content folder.</b>
</p>

<br>

<h3>Understanding Project Content</h3>
<p>
When a project is created for the first time, your IDE will make several folders for your project.<br>
One of these folders is the project's Content folder.<br>
Your project's Content folder will be at something like  "...\Desktop\Game1\Game1\Game1\Content"<br>
Your pipeline project file (.mgcb) will live in this folder.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Understanding Game Content</h3>
<p>
When a game builds, it creates it's own set of folders to run from.<br>
One of these folders is the game's Content folder.<br>
Your game's Content folder will be at something like "...\Desktop\Game1\Game1\Game1\bin\DesktopGL\x86\Debug\Content"<br>
The pipeline tool will automatically transform your game assets into XNBs and copy them into the game's folder.<br>
Your game's source code will look for game assets (XNBs) in this folder, unless you tell it otherwise.
