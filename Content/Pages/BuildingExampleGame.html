<h1>Building An Example Game</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will download, build, and play an example game.<br>
This article assumes that you have completed all previous articles.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Download the Example Game Archive</h3>
<p>
Right-click and save the following archive to your computer.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><a href="../Assets/RescueDog.rar" >RescueDog Game Archive (59MB)</a></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Decompress the archive into a folder, then navigate to the project directory.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/rescueDogFolder.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>
<p>
Double-click the RescueDog solution file to open it in your IDE.<br>
Once opened, check to see if any errors have been generated.<br>
Hopefully, there are no errors. Now you can build the project.<br>
Press F5 to build and run the project.<br>
You should get a window similar to below.<br>
</p>

<br><br>



<p>
For now, just play around with the game to get a feel for it.<br>
In this game, you control a bouncy happy dog lost in a cave.<br>
You can move with the arrow keys, or WASD keys, or a gamepad.<br>
Press spacebar or press the A button on the gamepad to make the dog bark.<br>
<br>
The goal of the game is to lead your human to the cave's exit.<br>
Along the way, you'll encounter spiders that can bite your human.<br>
You'll want to bark at the spiders to scare them away.<br>
If your human gets bit, you'll lose the game.<br>
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this article we downloaded a game's source code and opened it in our IDE.<br>
Then we built the game's source code into an executable file and play tested the game.<br>
Next we'll begin deconstructing the game's design and codebase.
