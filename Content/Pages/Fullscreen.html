<h1>Making The Game Fullscreen</h1>
<p>
There are three options for making a game fullscreen.<br>
The first option is by using the graphicsManager's built in fullscreen functionality.<br>
The second option is to allow window resizing, so the player can press the fullscreen button on the game window.<br>
The third option is by matching the game window's size to the user's display size.<br>
Each option has it's own set of pros and cons, discussed below.
</p>








<br><br>
<h3>Option 1 - Use graphics.ToggleFullScreen()</h3>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	graphics.ToggleFullScreen();
	graphics.ApplyChanges();
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
It's easy and simple. Whatever resolution your game is will be stretched to match the user's display.
No additional code is necessary to ensure your game displays in fullscreen.<br>
<br>
<b>Cons</b><br>
If the ratio of your game window doesn't match the user's display ratio, your game will be stretched or squashed.
In other words, you dont have any control over how your game will be displayed. 
Any textures or images your game displays will be scaled up as well, usually with blurry results.
This option does not preserve the original quality of textures or images. 
If you deeply care about the quality of your textures or images, then you probably don't want to use this option. 
By default the game window's titlebar will be hidden too.
</p>

<h3>Option 2 - Allow Resizing</h3>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	Window.AllowUserResizing = true;
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
It's easy and simple, but the game won't start in fullscreen, unless you set the game's resolution to the user's display resolution.
Essentially, you've created the <b>option</b> for fullscreen.<br>
<br>
<b>Cons</b><br>
Your game will be displayed at different aspect ratios, even uncommon ones.
Consider that the user could resize the window to a vertical oriented portrait mode.
Or the window could be resized to a very wide, but narrow cinema aspect ratio.
This means you would have to program your game's UI to function in these uncommon aspect ratios.
The window's titlebar <b>must</b> be displayed as well, otherwise the user can't resize or fullscreen the game.
</p>

<h3>Option 3 - Match the User's Display</h3>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();

	int displayWidth = GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Width;
	int displayHeight = GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Height;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = displayWidth;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = displayHeight;

	this.IsMouseVisible = true;
	Window.IsBorderless = true;
	graphics.ApplyChanges();
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
The game starts fullscreen, without any border.<br>
<br>
<b>Cons</b><br>
Your game will be displayed at different aspect ratios, but you can determine this ratio prior to changing the game window
and the game can react accordingly - preserving the scale and quality of it's textures or images.
You'll also need to create a way to exit the game - don't assume everyone knows how to quit a program via keyboard input.
