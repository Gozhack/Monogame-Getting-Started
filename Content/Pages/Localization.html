<h1>Localization</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will discuss localization.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>What is Localization?</h3>
<p>
Localization is the process of adapting a product or content to a specific locale or market. <br>
Translation is only one of several elements of the localization process. <br>
In addition to translation, the localization process may also include adapting graphics to a target market.<br>
<br>
For the puposes of the example game RescueDog, we only need to do translation of in game text.<br>
</p>




<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Handling Multiple Languages</h3>
<p>
If you game has a lot of in-game text, then you'll want to display that text using a font.<br>
You'll want to add a font to your content pipeline project that supports your target language.<br>
Then you'll need to store each string of in-game text somewhere, along with it's translation.<br>
Based on the player's selected language, you would then draw the appropriate string using the correct font.<br>
This is generally the approach used by larger games, but it's pretty complicated.<br>
<br>
For this getting started example, we're going to use a solution that is simple - but doesn't scale well.<br>
If your game has a lot of in-game text, you don't want to use this solution.<br>
RescueDog only has 8 unique strings of text in the game, so this solution works well in this case.<br>
We're going to use a sprite sheet, instead of a font, to display our in-game text.<br>
<br>
That means our in-game text will be handled using sprite objects.<br>
This is easy to explain and simple to implement,  plus we don't need to load a language specific font.<br>
We can also control how our text is displayed down to the pixel, because it's actually a texture.<br>
Look at the english and japanese text sprite sheets the game uses below:<br>
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>



<p>
RescueDog is setup to use a texture named titleSheet for all in-game text sprites.<br>
We simply need to tell the game to load a different texture in order to change all in-game text.<br>
Open Game1.cs and navigate to the LoadContent() method.<br>
Find the two lines as displayed below.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="4" readonly>
titleSheet = Content.Load<Texture2D>(@"English");
//titleSheet = Content.Load<Texture2D>(@"Japanese");
</textarea>	

<p>
Uncomment the line that loads the japanese texture, then comment out the line that loads the english texture.<br>
Now the game will be displayed in japanese, including a japanese game logo in glorious pixel perfect 3d.<br>
You just couldn't do that using a font based translation solution.<br>
</p>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Taking It Further</h3>
<p>
For now, I'm happy just to have RescueDog available in English and Japanese.<br>
However, it's fairly straightforward to add support for another language.<br>
Simply create a copy of the english sheet, then replace the text, making sure you match each text's position.<br>
Add the new sheet into the content pipeline, or just replace the english sheet.<br>
Build the content, then in Game1.cs either load the new sheet or load the english sheet you replaced.<br>
That's it.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this article we looked at two techniques for handling translating in-game text.<br>
We explored the technique used in RescueDog and discussed how to add additional languages to the game.<br>
