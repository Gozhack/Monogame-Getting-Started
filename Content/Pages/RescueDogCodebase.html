<h1>RescueDog's Codebase</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will inspect the example game's codebase.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>What is a Codebase?</h3>
<p>
The term codebase refers to the collection of source code that is used to build a game.<br>
This includes the game's classes, and any other libraries or dependencies the game may have.<br>
In this article we will only be discussing the example game's classes.<br>
</p>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspecting RescueDog's Classes</h3>
<p>
RescueDog is composed of a small number of classes that interact with each other to make the game function.<br>
When one class interacts with another class, the two classes are said to be <b>'coupled'</b>.<br>
This means the two classes are interdependent, or dependent on each other.<br>
Modifying one class may require that the other class be modified as well.<br>
<br>
As a game grows, you will likely add more classes and more connections between these classes.<br>
Depending upon how you architect or structure these connections, your codebase may become overly complex.<br>
Changing one class may cause a ripple effect, forcing you to change many other classes.<br>
It's important that you design these connections well, so changes in one class don't ripple.<br>
<br>
RescueDog's classes have many connections between them, and can be defined as a <b>tightly coupled codebase</b>.<br>
However, each class has a specific responsibility and that responsbility is limited to only that class.<br>
You should also know that almost all class members are defined with the <b>Public</b> access modifier.<br>
Therefore, RescueDog's codebase rarely implements the OOP concept of Encapsulation.<br>
<br>
Why was the codebase created this way? <b>To keep it simple to understand and easy to modify</b>.<br>
If an event based system were used instead of coupled classes, it would be necessary to explain events and delegates.<br>
If a message passing system were used, it would be necessary to explain message passing.<br>
These can be complicated to explain, and come with computational overhead.<br>
In contrast, class coupling is fast and easy to explain.<br>
<br>
With that out of the way, let's look at an overview of RescueDog's classes:<br>

Note Screen class is the Base Class for BootScreen, GameScreen, and WonScreen.<br>
RescueDog's codebase only has 3 inherited classes.<br>
</p>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Understanding The Program's Path</h3>
<p>
To get a better understanding of how the game starts and progresses, I've created something called an Execution Graph.<br>
This graph shows where the program first begins, and the path the program takes until the user quits the game.<br>
The game essentially loops between three screens: BootScreen, GameScreen, and WonScreen.<br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this article we discussed what a codebase is, and took a look at RescueDog's codebase.<br>
You should know what classes RescueDog has, but we didn't discuss what each class does.<br>
We will explore each class in depth in the next article.<br>
