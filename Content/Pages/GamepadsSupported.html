<h1>Supported Controllers</h1>


<p>In this article, we will examine what types of controllers are supported by MonoGame.<br>
We will also create a function to inspect a connected controller's properties.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>What is a Gamepad?</h3>
<p>
A Gamepad is a controller. In MonoGame controllers are referred to as gamepads.<br>
Because MonoGame was built upon XNA, MonoGame supports Xbox360 controllers by default.<br>
MonoGame also supports other types of controllers, but there is no official list of supported controllers.<br>
<br>
However, you can check to see if MonoGame supports your controller through code.<br>
Below we create a function called <b>InspectGamePad()</b>.<br>
Add this function to InputHelper.cs.
</p>
<textarea rows="40" readonly>
public void InspectGamePad(int playerNum)
{
	GamePadCapabilities gpc = GamePad.GetCapabilities(playerNum);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("inspecting gamepad #" + playerNum);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t type: " + gpc.GamePadType);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has left X joystick: " + gpc.HasLeftXThumbStick);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has left Y joystick: " + gpc.HasLeftYThumbStick);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has A button: " + gpc.HasAButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has B button: " + gpc.HasBButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has X button: " + gpc.HasXButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Y button: " + gpc.HasYButton);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has back button: " + gpc.HasBackButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has big button: " + gpc.HasBigButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has start button: " + gpc.HasStartButton);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Dpad Down button: " + gpc.HasDPadDownButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Dpad Left button: " + gpc.HasDPadLeftButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Dpad Right button: " + gpc.HasDPadRightButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Dpad Up button: " + gpc.HasDPadUpButton);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Left Shoulder button: " + gpc.HasLeftShoulderButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Left Trigger button: " + gpc.HasLeftTrigger);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Left Stick button: " + gpc.HasLeftStickButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Left vibration motor: " + gpc.HasLeftVibrationMotor);

	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Right Shoulder button: " + gpc.HasRightShoulderButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Right Trigger button: " + gpc.HasRightTrigger);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Right Stick button: " + gpc.HasRightStickButton);
	System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("\t has Right vibration motor: " + gpc.HasRightVibrationMotor);
}

<p>
The above function InspectGamePad() uses MonoGame's GamePad.GetCapabilities() method.<br>
This collects all the available information about an attached controller.<br>
Then we report on what kind of capabilities the controller has.<br>
<br>
You could use this in your game to make sure an attached controller has the buttons your game requires.<br>
Perhaps your game only requires the A button and a joystick?<br>
Using the above method you can check for an A button and joystick, or alert the user their controller is unsupported.<br>
<br>
If MonoGame doesn't recognize your controller, there's not much you can do.<br>
This is likely due to the computer missing the controller's drivers.<br>
The best thing you can do as a developer is to alert the player that their controller is unsupported.
</p>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Using InspectGamePad()</h3>
<p>
Now that we've added a function to inspect an attached gamepad, let's update Game1.cs to check our controller.<br>
Add the code below to Game1.Update(), near the end of the method.<br>
<br>
Note that we are passing a value of 1 to the InspectGamePad() method.<br>
This means InspectGamePad() is checking Player1's controller, but you may have multiple controllers attached.<br>
Simply change the passed value to 1, 2, 3, or 4 to check different Player's controllers.
</p>
<textarea rows="5" readonly>
if (inputHelper.IsNewKeyPress(Keys.Enter)) { inputHelper.InspectGamePad(1); }
</textarea>	
<p>
Run your game by pressing F5, then press the Enter key.<br>
You should see output similar to the image below.<br>
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>
If your controller is unsupported your output will probably look like this.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/gamepadUnsupported.jpg"></center>
<br><br>
<p>
If the controller is unsupported, the best thing you can do is alert the player.
</p>



<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You created a method in InputHelper to inspect a controller's capabilities.<br>
You then added code to Game1.cs to inspect an attached controller.<br>
Finally, you learned about how to inspect different attached controllers.<br>
