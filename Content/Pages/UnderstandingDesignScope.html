<h1>Understanding Design and Scope</h1>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the example game's design and scope.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>





<h3>What is Game Design?</h3>
<p>
Game Design refers to the process of planning the content, rules, and gameplay of a game.<br>
You make choices about the type of art and sound the game will use.<br>
You will decide how the user controls and interacts with the game.<br>
You plan the rules and conditions of winning, losing, and progressing.<br>
<br>
Game Design is not a simple topic that can be described in a few sentences.<br>
In fact, Game Design can mean different things to different people.<br>
<br>
One person may focus on the characters and their stories, and the game's story.<br>
While another person may focus on the art and sound and experience of the game.<br>
Another person may focus on how the art and sound is programmed and interacted with.<br>
All of these people are designing aspects of a game.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Managing Game Design</h3>
<p>
As an indie developer, with a small team and small budget, it can be hard to manage a game's design.<br>
It is advisable that you start small, finish fast, then build upon those successes.<br>
After a few projects you will start to understand what's possible and how to design better.<br>
Keep in mind that it's all a learning experience - sometimes the most valuable knowledge comes from failure.<br>
<br>
For RescueDog, the game design was small and simple: the player controls a dog in a cave.<br>
The goal of the game is to lead your human companion to the cave's exit.<br>
That was the original design of the game - however, a few ideas were added.<br>
And everytime an idea was added, the game's <b>scope</b> increased.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>What is Scope?</h3>
<p>
The term Scope refers to limiting the features and functionalities that your game will have.<br>
Why would you want to limit your game? Because a game without limits never gets finished.<br>
Scope is also the discipline of removing game mechanics that don't support the core gameplay.<br>
<br>
Generally as scope increases, so does the amount of work necessary to complete the game.<br>
And while some ideas sound cool at first, they can be implemented poorly, or just don't fit.<br>
Managing scope is hard to do. Even big companies with big budgets often manage a game's scope poorly.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Managing Scope</h3>
<p>
<b>As an indie developer, you must be wary not to get caught in the trap of ever expanding scope.</b><br>
Scope is best managed by creating a clear document detailing what the game will do and how it will do it.<br>
Then scrape away features and functionality until only the core gameplay remains.<br>
You may also want to simplify the core gameplay down to the essentials.<br>
<br>
For RescueDog, the scope expanded, but was kept small: one dog, one human, some spiders, and a cave level.<br>
The original game design didn't call for spiders to chase and bite the human.<br>
The addition of spiders to the game increased the game's scope, and increased the amount of work required.<br>
However, this addition supported the core gameplay and was limited to just one enemy and one action.<br>
If I decided to add in 10 different enemy types, then I likely would not of finished the example game.<br>
</p>










<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You should now have an understanding of what game design and scope is.<br>
You should also understand the game design and scope of the example game RescueDog.<br>
Next we will look at the art assets the example game requires.<br>
