<h1>Inspecting Game1.cs</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will inspect the Game1.cs class. <br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Open Game1.cs in the Editor</h3>
<p>
Double click on Game1.cs in the solution explorer.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/game1Class.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>

<p>
This displays the Game1 class in the editor:
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/editingGame1.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>


<p>
Let's look at some of Game1's code:
</p>


<textarea rows="8" readonly>
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;

namespace Game1
{
    public class Game1 : Game
    {
</textarea>


<p>
First, Game1 requires some things to run properly, so we have <i>using</i> statements that include the XNA framework, graphics, and input. 
Then we tell the game which namespace it exists in. 
We see Game1 inherits from the class of Game from the line:
</p>
<textarea rows="3" readonly>
public class Game1 : Game
</textarea>


<p>
So, Game is known as the base class of Game1. 
Game1 extends the class of Game with it's own functionality. 
In order for Game1 to have it's own unique functionality, Game1 must overwrite some of game's methods. 
Game defines the methods Initialize(), LoadContent(), UnloadContent(), Update(), and Draw(). 
Game1 will overwrite each of these methods with it's own methods. 
Let's look at the first method, labeled Game1():
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Inspect The Constructor</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
public Game1()
{
	graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);
	Content.RootDirectory = "Content";
}
</textarea>

<p>
This method is known as a constructor, and a constructor is called when a class is created.
In this constructor, the graphics device manager is set and the content root directory is set.
The game needs a graphics device manger to draw things to the game window.
The game also needs to know where to look for game assets, like textures, meshes, and fonts.
This line <i>Content.RootDirectory = "Content";</i> tells the game to look in the Content folder.<br>
<br>
If you look in the solution explorer window, you can see that your game has a Content folder.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/contentFolder.jpg" ></center>
<br><br><br><br>









<h3>Inspect Initialize()</h3>
<p>	
Initialize is called once, after the game class is constructed.
Think of this as the game starting up.
Notice the term override in this line:
</p>
<textarea rows="3" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
</textarea>	
<p>
Override in C# means that this class (Game1) is over writing the base class' initialize method.
Think of it like this: Game.Initialize() is overwritten by Game1.Initialize().
Game defines what a 'game' is. Game1 is your game, and you get to define what you want it to be.
For example, here we can set the size of the game window like this:
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1280;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 720;
}
</textarea>	
<p>
Or we could show/hide the mouse cursor, and allow the user to resize the game window:
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	this.IsMouseVisible = true;
	Window.AllowUserResizing = true;
}
</textarea>	
<p>
Go ahead and rename your game window to "MyFirstGame":
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	Window.Title = "My First Game";
}
</textarea>	
<p>Press F5 to run your game and see your changes. See? You're getting the hang of it.</p>	
<br><br><br><br>








	
<h3>Inspect LoadContent()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void LoadContent()
{
	spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Load content is called once, after initialize.
This is where the game expects to load assets from the Content folder.
Here the game creates a new spriteBatch. 
A SpriteBatch is used to draw textures and sprites to the game window. 
We'll discuss SpriteBatch in greater detail in a seperate tutorial.
Don't worry about SpriteBatch right now.
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>

	
	
	
	
	
	
<h3>Inspect UnloadContent()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void UnloadContent()
{
	// TODO: Unload any non ContentManager content here
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Note that this method is empty and essentially does nothing right now.
That's because we haven't loaded any content - so there's nothing to unload.
Later on when you have loaded content and you need to unload it, you might use this method to do so.
However, unloading a game's content while the game is running would likely cause errors and a crash.
It's not good practice to manage a large game's content using these loadContent and unloadContent methods.
This should be the responsibility of a content manager, or a screen. 
We'll talk more about that later.
For simple games or experiments, loadContent and unloadContent will suffice.
Let's move on to the two most important methods, update and draw.
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>









<h3>Inspect Update()</h3>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
	if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed || Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
		Exit();
	base.Update(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	
<p>	
The update method is called constantly, every frame or tick while a game runs.
If you've heard of the term "60 frames per second" then you are familiar with what a frame is.
Each frame, update is called. For a game running at 60 frames per second, this means Update() is called every 16ms.
Update() methods are commonly used to track, inspect, change, and calculate game data.
If you inspect this method you can see the first line of code contains an if statement that reads input.
In this case, input and update occur in the same method.
However, it is common to seperate input from the update method, as input and update tend to contain lots of code.
Let's inspect the if statement in update():
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed || Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
	Exit();
</textarea>	
<p>
Here you can see the game getting the input state of any attached gamepad or keyboard.
Then the state is checked to see if the user is pressing the gamepad's back button or keyboard's escape key.
Either input triggers the Exit() method, which exits the game and closes the game window.
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>








<h3>Inspect Draw()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
	GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);
	base.Draw(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Draw() is called constantly, just like Update(). However, Draw() is called <b>after</b> Update().
So in terms of execution, each frame your game calls Update(), then Draw(). 
At 60 frames per second, this means every 16ms <b>both</b> Update() and Draw() are called. 
Because of time constraints like 16ms, the Update and Draw methods should be kept as fast as possible.
Monogame limits how fast a game can run to 60 frames per second, 
so if Update+Draw take less than 16ms to finish the game will wait until the next frame should be called.
So what does draw actually do?
Well, draw is where the game draws textures, sprites, images, meshes, and text to the screen.
Let's change the background color to something else, like black:
</p>
<textarea rows="4" readonly>
GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);
</textarea>	
<br><br>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
And that's it! You should now have a solid understanding of how your game class operates.
You should be able to: change the size of the game window, show or hide the mouse cursor, disable or allow
resizing the game window, rename the game window, and change the background color of your game.
